GRAVITY implementation plan

1) make a grid that's accessible via array
	a) board[][] array that I can itterate through
	b) each board tile should have .center and .corner properties so I can access its info easily
	c) for visibility, maybe draw lines delineating tiles
2) put stuff on the screen--walls and space
	a) for every tile where tile.wall = true, put a wall (fill a black rectangle)
	b) initially, do this manually. Later, can compare to an array from a text file; if textfile array element contains X, set corresponding board array to tile.wall = true
	c) then, make a sprite (probably just a circle to start with)
3) sprite motion - L/R
	a) necessary properties: CUR_SPEED, MAX_SPEED, HORIZ_ACCEL, VERT_ACCEL
	b) when holding L or R, move sprite linearly L or R at CUR_SPEED, where speed gets incremented every tick by HORIZ_ACCEL until it equals MAX_SPEED. On release, decrement CUR_SPEED by HORIZ_ACCEL untli CUR_SPEED = 0. HORIZ_ACCEL should be small
		i. requires key code for L and R arrow keys
		ii. (on tick, draw sprite at sprite.pos)
4) gravity & jumping
	a) necessary properties: CUR_SPEED, MAX_SPEED, HORIZ_ACCEL, VERT_ACCEL
5) reversing gravity
6) goal point
7) level loader (populates board array from text file)
8) next level
9) obstacles: spikes (cause death), buttons (open locks)
10) bells and whistles like a start screen, timer, help text, etc.
